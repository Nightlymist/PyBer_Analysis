# PyBer_Analysis
Simulation: analyze ride shares at Pyber to determine frequency and the affordability of the communities. 

## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of the new analysis is to improve the access of the services. Also to analyze the affodability of neighborhoods that are not frequently used. 


## Results: 
As shown in table 1, the most frequent rides, drivers and fares is the urban with 1625 total rides, 59602 total drivers, and 39854.38 total fares. Suburban second largest use of ride share, drivers and total fares with 625 rides, 8570 drivers, 19356.33 total fares. Rural being the smallest with 125 total rides, 537 total drivers and 437.93 total fares in the area. The highest average ride for city type is rural that costs about 34.62 dollars per ride. The second highest is suburban which costs about 30.97 dollars per ride. The lowest average cost is 24.52 dollars per ride. The highest ratio between money earned by average driver is about 8.05 dollars per driver at rural city area. The medium average earning is suburban with 2.25 dollars per driver. The lowest average earning per driver is urban city with 0.66 dollars per driver.

Table 1. This table show total rides, total driver, total fares, average ride and average drive for each city type; rural, suburban, and urban. 

Urban total fares are the highest out of the two with a range of 1600 dollars to 2500. From the start of January, there is a slow increase of fares in urban fares. During February to late March there is a peak with total fares that slowly decrease and then rapidly increase by the first week of april. Again there is a slow decrease until the end of the month. The suburban fares are from about 700 dollars to 1300 dollars for the months of January to April. For suburban there is an increase in total fares until mid January and then a decrease in fares until second week of february. In the last week of February, there is a rapid increase in fares and then decreases until the about 850 dollar total fares. During the month of March until mid april, the total fares stay at around 1000 dollars. Then the total fares increase to about 1300 dollars worth of fares by the end of April. For urban the range is from about 60 dollars to 500 dollars. The fares for rural are relatively stable compared to urban and suburban ranges. There is not much different in rural fares from January to April.

Figure 1. The graph shows the amount of fares per week from Jan 06, 2019 to April 28, 2019 for each city type; rural, suburban, and urban. 


## Summary: 
After the finding above there are 3 recommendation with amount of drivers in each type of city. 
Recommendation #1: Keeping most of the drivers in urban because of the frequency than the other types of city. They are travelling shorter distances that the rural and suburban earning less money per ride but the frequency of fares make up in price.
Recommendation #2: The earning of suburban is relatively lower than urban general but does get a decent amount of revenue. There should be more drivers than rural but less than 
Recommendation #3: Having relatively fewer drivers in rural but still having drivers in the area for the need. This is because there are not a lot of fares occuring but the distance needed to drive elsewhere makes the fare highest amount per ride.
